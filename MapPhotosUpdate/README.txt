TF2 Rich Presence

Took about a week's worth of work, hopefully it was worth the wait.

To setup:
1) Get Node.JS : https://nodejs.org/en/ (Just get LTS version)
2) Install it
3) Open CMD (Windows key, type CMD, click first result)
4) Type 'npm install --save discord.js' without quotes
5) Type 'npm install discord-rpc'

5.5) Get Python from here (Recommended - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/python-3.6.3-amd64-webinstall.exe): https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/

6) Close CMD
7) Open Steam
8) Right click Team Fortress 2, properties, set launch options..., then type -condebug, close it.
9) Put the path to your TF folder in path.txt, typically 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf', follow the instructions in path.txt
10) Run the python file (TF2 RP Python Component.py)
11) Run the launcher.bat file
12) Done!

Just close all windows when done :clap: and if it still shows you playing TF2, close all CMD windows or CTRL R on discord.

Hope you enjoy this, oh and anyone who manages to package/freeze this, contact me on gamebanana and we can sort something out!
