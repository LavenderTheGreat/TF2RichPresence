C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf

This should be the path to your TF folder, where console.log resides. This path should not contain any \ s and if those do exist they should be replaced with /s.

EXAMPLE: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf

If this is empty it will use a default path.

If you are fussy and change the path everytime, this can contain 'manual', which opens a file dialog, but also leaves a laggy Tkinter window open
