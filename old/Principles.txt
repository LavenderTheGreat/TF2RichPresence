The TF2 rich presence mods runs on a series of principles I designed that makes it adaptable to a large amount of games, including other source games out of the box, but new games need tinkering.

The principles are as follows:
1) The client is in two parts, part A, the JS, part B, the Python.
2) The python writes a gameinfo.txt, this is the source of information for JS.

A1.a) The JS is built upon a basic construct which diffrentiates two types of info, official and community, these are done in if statements.
A1.b) This was updated in the map images update, which takes a map name and a field which tells it is it part of two categories, icon or non icon, icon will use a map field to grab an icon, of course in action this could be changed to weapon or whatever else you decide.
A2) This is forwarded to a discord RPC connection.

B1) The python grabs a log file from a location predestined in a file.
B2) It then splits it into lines, then grabs lines which it predicts has the needed values (In TF2 these are lines that begin with certain fields such as 'Map: '
B3) It parses this data via split functions then inserts the result to a series of variables.
B4) These are written on a line by line basis to gameinfo.txt where it is read by the JS.

The idea is to work from log files, as most game can produce them. This also means its not tampering with internal files and can never be picked up as a cheat of any form, which is good.

Go forth and do me proud, with this word, I give you full use of the code provided herein the repo. Remember, credit me and me and you will be fine.
